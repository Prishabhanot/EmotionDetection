The EmotionDetection project leverages a webcam to analyze and detect emotions in real-time, presenting results through a dynamically updating bar chart and overlaying emotion labels on the video feed. It also records the processed video, creates a GIF of the live updates, and generates a static chart depicting cumulative emotion trends over time. While the code can be applied broadly, it was specifically developed for a project aimed at monitoring infants during sleep to detect potential signs of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), though its versatility allows it to be adapted for emotion analysis in other contexts.
